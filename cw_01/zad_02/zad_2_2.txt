Write regular expressions for the following languages. By “word”, we mean
an alphabetic string separated from other words by whitespace, any relevant
punctuation, line breaks, and so forth.
1. the set of all strings with two consecutive repeated words (e.g., “Humbert Humbert” and “the the” but not “the bug” or “the big bug”):
\b(\w+)\s+\1\b

2. all strings that start at the beginning of the line with an integer and that
end at the end of the line with a word:
^[0-9]+\s+[A-Za-z]$

3. all strings that have both the word 'grotto' and the word 'raven' in them
(but not, e.g., words like grottos that merely contain the word grotto):
\b(?=.*b\grotto\b)(?=.*\braven\b).*

4. write a pattern that places the first word of an English sentence in a
register. Deal with punctuation:
^\s*[\p{Pd}]*\s*([A-Za-z'-]+)
